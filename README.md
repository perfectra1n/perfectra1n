- 👋 Hi, I’m @perfectra1n! I love Cybersecurity, DevOps, and homelabbing.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and DevOps. Everything from cloud pentesting, to malware anaylysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Kubernetes in my Homelab, and helping FOSS projects 👀
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Cybersecurity and pushing FOSS forward, I also don't mind DevOps related tools.
- 📫 You can reach me at perfectra1n@perfectra1n.com!
